Introduction
============

The LidDrivPy (Lid-Driven Cavity) Python_ package is a Computational Fluid Dynamics solver that computes the steady-state velocity and pressure fields for the lid-driven cavity problem on a uniform staggered Cartesian grid, by applying the finite volume method to the Navier-Stokes equations with a predictor-corrector algorithm.
This package was created by Tristan Lee for the final project of ASE382Q.11: Foundations of Computational Fluid Dynamics taught at the University of Texas Austin in Fall 2019 by Dr. Fabrizio Bisetti.
