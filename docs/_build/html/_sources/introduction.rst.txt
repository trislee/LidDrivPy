Introduction
============

The PyCUP (Python Cuda Primitives) Python_ package is a collection of highly-optimized routines for performing fundamental mathematical batch operations on arrays and stacks of arrays using CUDA.
These operations are implemented as computational engines that make both NumPy and PyCUDA array-based implementations accessible through a shared standard interface.
